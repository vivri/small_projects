1) GENETIC ARITHMETIC
+---------------------------------------+

Needs to be extracted and built. Read the README inside the archive. I think it's a pretty cool demonstration of the power of evolutionary search :).


NOTE: Both Conway's life and the Waves sim source code are in the 'alife' folder/package.

2) CONWAY'S LIFE
+---------------------------------------+

Needs to be built. A very rudimentary LIFE sim, using very primitive drawing techniques. The startup is always random.
command line args: x-size y-size, where 'size' is 5 pixels. On older graphic cards, it's not recommended to run over 150x150.



3) WAVES SIMULATION
+---------------------------------------+
Needs to be built. An interestingly realistic cellular-automata take on simulating behavior of liquids. Here are the command-line args: x-size y-size random-or-rain, where 'size' is 3 pixels, and the random-or-rain (0 or 1) is a startup configuration, where 0 is random, and 1 simulates rain. Please be patient while the random configuration stabilizes into a nice pattern :). On older graphic cards, it's not recommended to run over 150x150.
